DevOps Open-source 3 Tier Project Deployment | Virtualisation on AWS EC2

In this project, I've hosted a 3-tier application wanderlust which I have collected from github and hostted it on my local machin first then migreted in AWS by using virtualisation.


wanderlust is a three-tier web app which is having three parts: Frontend is made in ReactJS, Backend in NodeJS and a database in MongoDB.

First I've collected the code from github, then tested in my local machine. Then I've created a VM on AWS and hosted this web app on the virtual server.

**Steps for creationg a VM on AWS:**

1. select your region and name your VM.
